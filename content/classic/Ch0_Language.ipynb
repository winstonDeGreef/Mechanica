    "\n",
    "Physics is the science that seeks to understand the fundamental workings of the universe: from the motion of everyday objects to the structure of atoms and galaxies. To do this, physicists have developed a precise and powerful language: one that combines mathematics, both colloquial and technical language, and visual representations. This language allows us not only to describe how the physical world behaves, but also to predict how it will behave under new conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, we introduce the foundational elements of this language, covering how to express physical ideas using equations, graphs, diagrams, and words. You’ll also get a first taste of how physics uses numerical simulations as an essential complement to analytical problem solving.\n",
    "\n",
    "This language is more than just a set of tools—it is how physicists *think*. Mastering it is the first step in becoming fluent in physics."

    "## Representations\n",
    "\n",
    "Physics problems and concepts can be represented in multiple ways, each offering a different perspective and set of insights. The ability to translate between these representations is one of the most important skills you will develop as a physics student. In this section, we examine three key forms of representation: equations, graphs and drawings, and verbal descriptions using the context of a base jumper, see {numref}`fig_basejump`.\n",

    "### Verbal descriptions\n",
    "\n",
    "Words are indispensable in physics. Language is used to describe a phenomenon, explain concepts, pose problems and interpret results. A good verbal description makes clear:\n",
    "- What is happening in a physical scenario;\n",
    "- What assumptions are being made (e.g., frictionless surface, constant mass);\n",
    "- What is known and what needs to be found.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{example} Base jumper: Verbal description\n",
    "Let us consider a base jumper jumping from a 300 m high building. We take that the jumper drops from that height with zero initial velocity. We will assume that the stunt is performed safely and in compliance with all regulations/laws. Finally, we will assume that the problem is 1-dimensional: the jumper drops vertically down and experiences only gravity, buoyancy and air-friction. \n",
    "\n",
    "We know (probably from experience) that the jumper will accelerate. Picking up speed increases the drag force acting on the jumper, slowing the *acceleration* (meaning it still accelerates!). The speed keeps increasing until the jumper reaches its terminal velocity, that is the velocity at which the drag (+ buoyancy) exactly balance gravity and the sum of forces on the jumper is zero. The jumper no longer accelerates. \n",
    "\n",
    "Can we find out what the terminal velocity of this jumper will be and how long it takes to reach that velocity?\n",

    "### Visual representations\n",
    "\n",
    "Visual representations help us interpret physical behavior at a glance. Graphs, motion diagrams, free-body diagrams, and vector sketches are all ways to make abstract ideas more concrete.\n",
    "- **Graphs** (e.g., position vs. time, velocity vs. time) reveal trends and allow for estimation of slopes and areas, which have physical meanings like velocity and displacement.\n",
    "- **Drawings** help illustrate the situation: what objects are involved, how they are moving, and what forces act on them.\n",

In general, $x$ will change with time as particles can move. Thus, we write $x(t)$ showing that the position, in principle, is a function of time $t$. How fast a particle changes its position is, of course, given by its velocity. This quantity describes how far an object has traveled in a given time interval: $v = \\frac{\\Delta x}{\\Delta t}$. However, this definition gives actually the average velocity in the time interval $\\Delta t$. The (momentary) velocity is defined as:\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, we define the acceleration as the change of the velocity over a time interval $\\Delta t$: $a = \\frac{\\Delta v}{\\Delta t}$. Again, this is actually the average acceleration and we need the momentary one:\n",
