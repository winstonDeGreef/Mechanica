    "## Periodic Motion\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many, many examples of periodic systems. We see them in physics, like the orbit of planets around their star. We find them in biology (like the predator-prey systems), in chemistry (oscillating reactions like the [Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belousov%E2%80%93Zhabotinsky_reaction)), and in economics (like demand-supply fluctuations). They show up in daily life: the day-night rhythm, the tides, children on a swing, your heart-beat. Periodic motions are by definition motions that repeat themselves after a fixed period of time, usually called 'the period'.\n",
    "\n",
    "A specific class of periodic motion is known as oscillatory motion, or simply oscillations. All oscillations are periodic, but not all periodic motions are oscillations. An oscillation involves movement back and forth around an equilibrium position. It is typically caused by a restoring force: a force that acts to return the system to equilibrium (in case of the mass spring system: $\\vec{F}=-k\\vec{u}$). However, due to inertia, the system overshoots this position. The restoring force then reverses direction, pushing the system back again, leading to continued oscillation.\n",

    "### Rabbits and Foxes\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example of a dynamic system that is periodic, we will take a look at the so-called predator-prey systems. These are well-known in biology and provide an interesting case. The idea is simple: the populations of rabbits growth as they multiply quickly. The idea in the prey-predator model is that growth rate is proportional to the population itself. For the rabbits that means that the derivative of the population of rabbits (with respect to time) is positive. If there are no foxes, the rabbit population will grow exponentially. Of course, in the real world that doesn't happen as sooner or later, the rabbits will ran out of food, resulting in starvation. However, we will assume here, that food is not limiting: but the number of foxes is. They stop the rabbit population from unbounded increasing. The more rabbits there are, the easier the foxes find food and the more foxes will survive childhood. A simple model reads as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{split}\n",
    "\\frac{dr}{dt} &= \\lambda_r r - \\mu_r r \\cdot f \\\\\n",
    "\\frac{df}{dt} &= - \\lambda_f f + \\mu_f r \\cdot f\n",
    "\\end{split}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "here $r$ and $f$ represent the rabbit and fox population, resp. $\\lambda_r$ is the growth rate of the rabbits: the more rabbits, the larger the offspring. The higher $\\lambda_r$ the more babies per rabbit. $\\mu_r$, on the other hand, represents the effectiveness of the hunting foxes: the larger this value the more rabbits they kill. Of course: more rabbits, but also more foxes also means more kills. Similar arguments apply to $\\lambda_f$ and $\\mu_f$. Note that the term with $\\lambda_f$ carries a negative sign: the net increase of the fox population is negative if there is insufficient food, that is, by itself more foxes die then that are born if there is no food.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is clearly a coupled and dynamic system. It is non-linear due to the product $r \\cdot f$, making it much more difficult to solve analytically then linear versions. In literature, this kind of system is known as Lotka-Volterra or prey-predator models. Below is a plot of the numerical solution of the rabbit and fox population (for $( \\lambda_r, \\mu_r,\\lambda_f, mu_f) = (0.2, 0.03, 0.1, 0.01) $ and initial conditions ($r_0$, $f_0$) = (80, 2)).\n",

That is not sustainable and when the number of rabbits is brought down substantially, also the number of foxes decreases, until both are almost extinct and the cycle repeats.\n",

    "#### Wilberforce Oscillator\n",
    "As a second example we look at the Wilberforce pendulum. This is a spring, suspended vertically, to which a weight is fixed at the free end. The weight can go up and down but also rotate in a horizontal plane. A sketch is given below. \n",

    "Wilberforce pendulum.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine that we pull $m$ a little down and let go. The spring will try to restore the position of the mass to the equilibrium position it was in prior to us pulling $m$ down. Consequently, $m$ will start oscillating in the vertical direction. However, something peculiar happens: the mass $m$ also starts to rotate (around the vertical axis). And also this rotation turns out to be a back and forth oscillation. But that is not all: the two oscillations are coupled: they feed each other. If the vertical oscillation is at a maximum amplitude, the rotational motion is almost zero and vice-versa.\n",

    "\n",
    "A Wilbertforce pendulum made by first year physics students\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The system can be modeled with simple means. We will just postulate them. Later on, we will see where the terms come from.  \n",
    "First, we note that the mass has kinetic energy, in two forms: due to the vertical motion ($\\frac{1}{2}m\\dot{z}^2$) and due to the rotational motion ($\\frac{1}{2}I\\dot{\\theta}^2$). Don't worry about the exact meaning for now.  \n",
    "Second, the mass has potential energy. We will ignore gravity (we could for instance do the experiment in the International Space Station, ISS). A potential energy is associated with the vertical motion and is the spring energy: $V_z = \\frac{1}{2}kz^2$, with $z$ the vertical position of the mass with respect to the equilibrium position, which we took as $z=0$. $k$ is the spring constant and represents the strength of the spring. We will come back to this later.  \n",
    "Then, we have potential energy associated with the rotation: $V_\\theta = \\frac{1}{2} \\delta \\theta^2$. $\\theta$ represent the rotation angle, where we have taken $\\theta = 0$ in the equilibrium position. $\\delta$ is the torsional spring constant: it represents how strongly the spring tries to push back against rotation.  \n",
    "Finally, the vertical position and the rotation influence each other. That can be understood by realizing that if you shorten the spring, the spring material has to go somewhere. It can not only change its vertical length as that would mean that the total length of the spring would reduce. But that would compress the spring material and that is not possible for solid material (unless you apply incredibly large forces). The spring just increases its number of windings a bit. But that implies rotation. Similarly, if we only rotate the spring, it will try to adjust its length. As a consequence, there is also a potential energy involved in the influencing of $z$ and $\\theta$ of each other. It can be modeled as $V_{z\\theta} = \\epsilon z \\theta$.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we ignore friction, then we have a system that can be described in terms of energy:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{1}{2}m\\dot{z}^2 + \\frac{1}{2}I\\dot{\\theta}^2 + \\frac{1}{2}kz^2 + \\frac{1}{2}\\delta \\theta^2 + \\epsilon z \\theta = E_0 $$\n",

    "The Wilberforce pendulum is clearly periodic. Moreover, it is an oscillation as there is back and forth motion around an equilibrium.\n",
    "\n",
    "But, it does give us a **big warning**: (numerical) solutions always have to be **assessed** against the features and principles of the problem at hand. In this case, our first numerical solution could not be right: **it violated energy conservation**. We were able, right from the start, to formulate the problem in terms of energy. Since we only had kinetic energy and potential energy we **knew up front** that the motion must be bounded!   \n",
    "That is why, we need a thorough understanding of physics. It is not sufficient to have the equations and put them in a 'solver'. It is the job of a physicist to understand and assess models, outcomes, etc against the laws of physics. Hence, we will dive into oscillations, starting from the beginning. \n",

    "## Harmonic Oscillation - archetype: Mass-Spring\n",
    "The archetype of an oscillation is the mass-spring system. It is the simplest version (simpler than the pendulum as we will see). And it can be recognized in many systems. We consider the following: a mass is attached to a spring. The other end of the spring is fixed. The mass can only move in one direction: the $x$-direction. The spring has a natural or rest length $l_0$. That is the length of the spring if no force is acting on it. If we pull the spring, it will exert a force that is proportional to the increase in length. Moreover, it is pointing in the direction opposite to the lengthening. In formula:\n",

It is good to realize, that this force makes sure that the distance from $m$ to the pivotal point is always $L$. In other words, this force is a consequence of the fixed length $L$ of the rod. It is the physics translation of the constraint: $L$ is constant.\n",

Thus, blue light of a wavelength of 450nm is compared to red light ($\\lambda$ = 650nm) $\\left ( 650/450 \\right ) ^4 = 4.4$ times more likely to be scattered. Consequently, the blue end from the (white) sun light has a reduced probability to reach our eye directly in comparison with the red end.

    "\n",
    "In the previous sections, we talked about oscillations of individual particles. Oscillations can also occur in a more collective mode. And there are plenty of examples: take for instance a violin or piano string. It is in essence an elastic string suspended between two fixed points. The string is under tension, that is: its natural length is (slightly) less than the distance between the two end points. As a consequence, equilibrium position of the string is a straight line and when brought out of equilibrium there is a net restoring force much like for the mass-spring system.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there are at least two important differences: (1) the restoring force is the net result from pulling on a small part of the string by its neighbor parts; (2) the entire string can oscillate in a direction perpendicular to the equilibrium position of the string, making the problem multi-dimensional.\n",

    "We will give here an intuitive derivation of the equation of motion. Don't worry if you don't grasp it fully. This will come back in your studies further down the line.\n",

    "In the figure below, a part of the string is drawn with special attention to a small part (the red line). On this small part the tension from the left and right side is pulling on the red part. This is visualized by the two blue arrows. In the inset, this is drawn at a larger scale. The two blue arrows are equal in magnitude ($T$) as the tension in the string is the same everywhere. But the direction in which the two blue forces are pulling is slightly different as the string is curved. \n",

    "$$ \\frac{n}{2} \\lambda  = L \\Leftrightarrow \\lambda = \\frac{2L}{n}  \\text{   with } n \\in N$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Further we see that the smaller the wavelength, the faster the oscillation. This is due to the relation $\\lambda \\cdot f = \\mathsf{v}$ that still holds: $f = \\frac{\\mathsf{v}}{\\lambda} = \\frac{n\\mathsf{v}}{2L}$.\n",

    "The traveling waves had as mathematical form $\\sin \\left (x - \\mathsf{v} t \\right )$. The standing waves take forms like $\\sin \\frac{x}{\\lambda} \\cdot \\sin ( 2\\pi ft)$. You will learn much more about this in e.g. Fourier Analysis classes.\n",

    "It is not necessary that a wave is caused by a tension in the material that tries to restore the equilibrium position. The restoring force can be of a different nature. A well know example is the water waves that we see on lakes and seas. Here gravity is the restoring force: it tries to pull a crest down and push a through up. The water inertia causes overshoot resulting in oscillations, that we call waves. In dealing with waves, we usually don't use the frequency $f$, but instead the angular velocity $\\omega = 2 \\pi f$. Similarly, frequently the wave length $\\lambda$ is replaced by the wavenumber $k \\equiv \\frac{2\\pi}{\\lambda}$. Note that these two quantities are also related to each other by the speed of the waves: $\\lambda \\cdot f = \\frac{2\\pi}{\\lambda} \\frac{\\omega}{2\\pi} = \\frac{\\omega}{k} = \\mathsf{v}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "For water waves (with large wave length) the angular momentum and the wave number are coupled to the depth, $h$, of the water:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\omega^2 = g k \\tanh (kh)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "From this we learn that waves on deep water travel much faster than on shallow water. This can be seen on our shores: the waves coming from the open sea are slowed down when the approach our beaches. But behind them the fast ones still come in. As a consequence, the wave gets squeezed in length and thus must get higher. This can be extreme with dramatic consequences: the Tsunami. The wave of the Tsunami is formed out in the open, where the sea is very deep. Here it travels at a very high speed which also means that it is a long wave. The Tsunami waves can travel ate velocities of 200m/s and have wave length of hundreds of kilometers. However at full sea their amplitude is in the centimeter, decimeter range. A ship at full sea will hardly notice the passing Tsunami wave. But when the approach the shore, the front of the wave is slowed down to tens of m/s. As the back is still coming in at full speed the wave amplitude has to increase. And thus a huge wave in terms of amplitude storms towards the shore. A wall of water is seen coming, crushing everything in its way.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sound waves are another type of waves that occur frequently. They can exist in solids, liquids and gasses. In contrast to the waves we have discussed so far, the amplitude is not perpendicular to the direction of traveling. It is what we call a longitudinal wave that oscillates in the same direction as it moves. The other waves are called transversal waves. \n",
    "\n",
    "For sound waves it is the pressure that is the restoring force. The 'crest' is compressed material, the 'through' is an expansion part. Newton was intrigued by sound waves and provided a theory for them. He found that the speed of sound in air, according to his theory, was about 290 m/s. In reality it is some 340 m/s. Newton was well aware of the mismatch. But he couldn't find a good explanation. It took another 100 years for Pierre Laplace corrected Newton's work and arrived at the correct answer. Newton did not know that sound is connected to adiabatic compression. He couldn't as the entire concept was not know. Laplace realized that Newton basically had made an isothermal solution and corrected this."
