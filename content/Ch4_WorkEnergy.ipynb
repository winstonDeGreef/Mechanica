This is the case for a particle that moves under the influence of two forces that cancel each other: $ \\vec{F}_1 = -\\vec{F}_2 $. From Newton 2, we immediately infer that if the two forces cancel each other, then the particle will move with a constant velocity. Hence, its kinetic energy stays constant.
